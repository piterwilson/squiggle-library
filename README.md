# Squiggle 

Javascript framework meant to make it easy to develop free educational online applications in the field of Animation.

## Description

The Squiggle library is a set of classes that are ready to use to implement animation drawing applications that output animated .gif's.

### Why make this?

This project is a direct child of the [Flipbook!](http://www.piterwilson.com/project/flipbook) project. This is an updated version of the same idea, but focused on the creation of educational applications that students and educators can use for free.

### Dependencies

The Squiggle library requires:

* require.js
* jquery
* Underscore
* Backbone

### Acknowledgments

* Squiggle uses [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) under the hood for its drawing routines.
* Squiggle uses [gif.js](http://jnordberg.github.io/gif.js/) to export .gif's.
* Squiggle uses [randomColor](https://randomcolor.llllll.li/) to generate nice random colors.

### License

This project is made for and dedicated to the public domain.
